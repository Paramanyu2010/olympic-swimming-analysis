    "text": "The data for this project comes from the SCORE Sports Data Repository, specifically their Olympic Swimming History dataset available at https://data.scorenetwork.org/swimming/olympic_swimming_history.html. This dataset contains comprehensive results from Olympic swimming competitions from 1912 to 2020, including 4,359 individual race results.\nThe original data source is olympics.com, and the dataset was compiled and made available by datasciencedonut on Kaggle. The data includes all athletes who competed in Olympic swimming events, not just medal winners, which makes it ideal for understanding the full spectrum of Olympic-level performance.\nData cleaning involved converting time formats from minutes:seconds.decimal to total seconds for analysis, removing DNS (Did Not Start) and DQ (Disqualified) entries, and filtering out obvious data entry errors or outliers. No observations were removed based on performance criteria - the goal was to include all legitimate competitive times to show the complete picture of Olympic swimming performance.\nThe dataset includes the following variables:\n\nLocation: Hosting city of the Olympics\nYear: Year of the Olympics (1912-2020)\nDistance: Distance in meters (relays show number of swimmers × distance per swimmer)\nStroke: Type of swimming stroke (Freestyle, Backstroke, Breaststroke, Butterfly, Individual Medley)\nRelay: Binary indicator (0 for individual events, 1 for relay events)\nGender: Men or Women\nTeam: Three-letter country code\nAthlete: Name of the athlete\nResults: Time in minutes:seconds.decimal format\nRank: Medal placement (1=Gold, 2=Silver, 3=Bronze, 4=No Medal, 0=DNS/DQ)"

    "text": "This project analyzes Olympic swimming performance data spanning over a century (1912-2020), examining how swimming times have evolved across different events and between men and women. Rather than focusing solely on winning times, this analysis includes all athlete performances to provide a comprehensive view of competitive swimming standards at the Olympic level.\nThe centerpiece of this analysis is an interactive ridgeline plot that allows users to explore the distribution of swimming times for each event, revealing patterns in performance consistency, the competitiveness of different events, and the evolution of swimming speeds over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance Consistency: Some events show tight clustering of times, indicating highly competitive fields\nEvent Difficulty: Longer distance events naturally show wider time distributions\nGender Comparisons: Clear patterns emerge when comparing men’s and women’s performance distributions\nOlympic Standard: The data reveals what it takes to compete at the highest level of swimming\n\nNavigate to the About page to learn more about this project, or visit Sources for information about the data."

    "text": "Based on this analysis of Olympic swimming data:\nHistorical Trends: Swimming speeds have improved consistently across all distances, with the most dramatic improvements occurring after 1960. This coincides with advances in training methods, nutrition, and pool technology.\nGender Differences: While men’s speeds remain higher on average, women’s swimming has seen remarkable growth rates, particularly in longer distances. The gap has been narrowing over time.\nDistance Specialization: Sprint events (≤100m) show the highest absolute speeds but relatively smaller improvement rates, while longer distances have seen more dramatic improvements as training and technique have evolved.\nModern Era: The period from 1980 onwards shows accelerated improvement, likely due to professional coaching, scientific training methods, and technological advances in equipment and facilities."
