This project analyzes Olympic swimming performance data from 1912-2020, focusing on the distribution of all athlete times rather than just winning performances. The code and data are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Paramanyu2010/olympic-swimming-analysis).

This project was created as part of [Kane's Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/).
